# entity.js

An es6 library for handling models on client-side. I'm writing this as an exercise, in order to learn about es6, so feel free to contribute! :)
Some es6 features will be missing for now, as they are not handled by babel yet. That forced me (with my current knowledge) to make a couple of ugly workarounds. I will try to fix them along the way.

## Installation

- git clone
- npm install
- build 
    - I have used browserify/watchify. It's pretty much the fastest way to get it running. Install browserify/watchify,
    then run browserify/watchify -v true #source file# -t babelify --outfile #destination file#
    https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/#installation

## Usage

The examples will be kept on the repo, with the library, while it's still in progress, and as things will keep changing extensively,
any kind of instructions are pointless for now.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
